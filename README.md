# newtons
A physics calculator in common lisp (no calc)


### Rules to implement
* metric 
* prefixes
* significant figures
* scientific notation - built in :D

### Math to implement
* f = ma
* displacement
* speed/velocity (differing between vector & non-vector)
* acceleration
* 1D motion
* gravity
* 2D vectors
* inertia/normal force
* mass/weight
* friction
* equilibrium
* rotational motion & torque
* static friction?
* circular motion/centripetal force
* work/energy/power
* potential/kinetic
