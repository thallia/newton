A physics calculator in common lisp (no calc)

A project to solidify my understanding of physics and its mathematics, as well as to teach me common lisp.

The wiki will soon be updated with physics concepts, laws, definitions, you name it.

### Rules to implement
* metric 
* prefixes
* significant figures

### Math to implement
* f = ma
* displacement
* speed/velocity (differing between vector & non-vector)
* acceleration
* 1D motion
* gravity
* 2D vectors
* inertia/normal force
* mass/weight
* friction
* equilibrium
* rotational motion & torque
* static friction?
* circular motion/centripetal force
* work/energy/power
* potential/kinetic

### Future features
* stoichiometry
* chemistry mathematics/laws/info
* biology concepts
